Selenium Automation suite for testing SauceDemo

This file contains few testcases to check the quality of https://www.saucedemo.com/ webApp. I'm using Junit framework in order to run the tests. Once the test suite increases we can scale the framwork by creating separte classes for tests and common methods using POM approach.
